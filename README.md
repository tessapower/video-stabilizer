# Video Stabilizer

TODO: add CI badges

An application of Lowe's Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)[^1] feature detection and Fischler and Bolles' RAndom SAmple Consesus (RANSAC)[^2] algorithm to compute robust estimate homography matrices to stabilize a video on a frame-by-frame basis.

## Example

| Original | Stabilized |
|:--------:|:----------:|
| ![Original Video](./docs/original.gif) | ![Stabilized Video](./docs/stabilized.gif) |

## Usage

The program should be very straight forward to use. Follow the steps below to stabilize a video:

- Start by clicking the `Import Video` button to select a video. Supported formats are `.MOV` ,`.MP4` or `.MPEG4`, `.WMV`, `.AVI`, and .`.FLV`.
- Once selected, the program will load your video.
- Click the `Stabilize` button. The program will begin stabilizing your video.
- When the video is finished, you'll see a message displayed in the log area.
- Click the `Save` button to select the folder where your stabilized video will be saved. The stabilized video will be saved as a new file with a different name.

## Limitations

- Currently only supports being run on Windows.
- Output videos are in MP4 format.

## Building

### Prerequisites

To build this project, please ensure that your system has the following software already installed:

- [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Loading and progress status indicators
- [ ] Preview of original video
- [ ] Preview of stabilized video
- [ ] Run stabilization in dedicated thread
- [ ] Custom file name for stabilized video
- [ ] Add support for logging
- [ ] Display video meta-data
- [ ] Support codecs for other platforms (currently only supports DIVX)
- [ ] Support multiple output formats
- [ ] Support running on MacOS and mainstream Linux distros
- [ ] Set up a vcpkg binary cache using [GitHub Actions Cache](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/consume/binary-caching-github-actions-cache)
